abstract = {Chemometric and statistical tools for data reduction and analysis abound, but the end objective of most analytical undertakings is to make informed decisions based on the data. Decision theory provides some highly instructive and intuitive tools to bridge the gap between data and optimal decisions. This tutorial provides a user-centric introduction to receiver operator characteristic curves, and related measures such as predictive values, likelihood ratios, and cost curves. Important considerations for choosing between these tools are discussed, as well as the primary methods for determining confidence intervals on the various measures. Numerous worked examples illustrate the calculations, their interpretation and potential drawbacks.}

ROC graphs are commonly used in medical decision making, and in recent years have been used increasingly in machine learning and data mining research. Although ROC graphs are apparently simple, there are some common misconceptions and pitfalls when using them in practice. The purpose of this article is to serve as an introduction to ROC graphs and as a guide for using them in research.}

They describe a new theory of cognition called connectionism that is challenging the idea of symbolic computation that has traditionally been at the center of debate in theoretical discussions about the mind. The authors' theory assumes the mind is composed of a great number of elementary units connected in a neural network. Mental processes are interactions between these units which excite and inhibit each other in parallel rather than sequential operations. In this context, knowledge can no longer be thought of as stored in localized structures; instead, it consists of the connections between pairs of units that are distributed throughout the network. Volume 1 lays the foundations of this exciting theory of parallel distributed processing, while Volume 2 applies it to a number of specific issues in cognitive science and neuroscience, with chapters describing models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought.}",
